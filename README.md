# sphere
<h1>Creating procedural mesh, approximation of sphere, in Godot<h1>
<p>There was two things I wanted to accomplish in this test.
First I wanted to learn, how to create mesh procedurally. Second, I wanted to make 
sphere which I can use as game map or board. Starting from icosahedron, tesselating
it and pushing tesselations outwards creates simple approximation of sphere.
